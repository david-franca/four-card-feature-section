## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid

### What I learned

I was able to study a little more about CSS selectors and how to use them to create creative layouts with few elements on the screen.

For example, the use of :nth-child and ::before

```css
.card:nth-child(1) {
  grid-row: 1 / 3;
  grid-column: 1 / 2;

  &::before {
    background-color: var(--cyan);
  }
}
```

### Continued development

In this simple project, I was able to see how there is still so much about CSS that I still don't know and that is very useful. CSS selectors and functions are very useful and it is worth studying a little more about them.
